Dear All:

We are taking the 20180531 versions and suggested following amendments to create 20180601 version of Constitution and BP Agreement:
We are suggesting the following amendment on constitution:

C1: Article I: 
Members shall not initiate violence or the threat of violence against another Member. Lawful prosecution of crimes with the goal of preserving life, liberty and property does not constitute initiation of violence.

C2: Addition to constitution:
Article XX Interim Constitution
This constitution is interim and is intended to remain in effect until a permanent constitution is written and ratified in a referendum.

C3: Change SYS to EOS (Article V)

I am suggesting the following amendment on BP Agreement
B1: 
I, {{producer}}, hereby agree to disclose and attest under penalty of perjury all ultimate beneficial owners of my company who own more than 10% and all direct shareholders.
